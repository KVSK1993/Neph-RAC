# Neph-RAC
+ Analyzed renal dataset (Grand River Hospitalâ€™s dialysis patient data) to classify patients, whether a patient will withdraw from
dialysis or not. Used SMOTE algorithm for upsampling of the minority class.
+ Used Area under ROC (AUROC) as performance metric and best results (0.6751) were achieved by using Logistic
Regression with L1 penalty.
+ The Renal dataset cannot be uploaded publically as it contains private information of patients.
